# 🧠 React Practice Components

A personal collection of React practice files designed to deepen my understanding of core and advanced React concepts.

> 📌 **Note:** This is strictly for learning purposes. Real-world, production-grade projects will be uploaded soon.

## 🚀 Live Demo UI

Once you run the project locally, you’ll see a simple dropdown like this:

```html
<select>
  <option>useState</option>
  <option>useRef</option>
  <option>useFormState</option>
  <option>forwardRef</option>
  <option>useTransitionState</option>
  <option>MORE</option>
</select>
```
